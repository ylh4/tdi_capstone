# Conflict Model: Forecasting the onset of Communal Conflict in the Horn of Africa
### Modeler: Yared Hurisa

## Introduction
### Overview

The goal of the Conflict model is to allow users to predict the onset of communal conflict (`cc_conflict`) at the sub-national level on a monthly basis. Conflict in this case can be defined as “identity conflict” which could be among religious groups, tribal/regional areas, communal and country specific areas at the local level. The model delivers to users a binary indicator of whether conflict is expected to be present in a geographic area. Upon completion, this model will allow users to see and predict the the presence of the conflict in space and a head of time. 

### Rationale

Communal conflicts are pervasive in East African countries such as South Sudan and Ethiopia due to a range of issues. These include the conflict that occur among groups with different ethnicity, religion, region, or livelihood backgrounds. The type of conflict is typically heightened by-elections, the implementation of controversial land tenure policies, federalism,  state use of force, and the unintended effects of public and private investments in the horn of Africa.  As a result, millions of people have been displaced and died in addition to the immeasurable economic losses incurred due to the conflict.

Appropriate early-warning systems that can meaningfully predict the onset of communal conflict is important to respond to the crisis ahead of time. This will have a significant impact on reducing the devastating consequence of conflict in terms of loss of lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure.
